                <b> Hobbies: </b> <br>
                Because we have such a large family our hobbies are diverse.  My wife loves to read, two of my daughters love art and drawing, most
                 of my daughters love anime, my son loves gaming, and I enjoy woodworking.  Our common hobby is absolutely traveling.  Here, I'll
                 share some advice on my hobby (woodworking) as well as traveling.  Over time I hope to rope in the family so they can share what 
                 they love as well.
