                <b> Hobbies: </b> <br>
                Because we have such a large family our hobbies are diverse.  My wife loves to read, two of my daughters love art and drawing, most
                 of my daughters love anime, my son loves gaming, and I enjoy woodworking.  Our common hobby is absolutely traveling.  Here, I'll
                 share some advice on my hobby (woodworking) as well as traveling.  Over time I hope to rope in the family so they can share what 
                 they love as well.

                <b> Woodworking: </b> <br>
                I love woodworking, it's pleasurable to see something through to to finish then be able to make great use out of it.  It's even
                         a better feeling when I'm able to use re-claimed wood.  One of my earliest projects of using reclaimed wood from pallets
                         was to build a wheel-burrow style planter for my wife.  Check out this video from Steve Ramsey's YouTube channel "Wood Working
                         for Mere Mortals".
