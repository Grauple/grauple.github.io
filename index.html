                <b> About Me: </b> <br>
                My name is Todd and this site is about me, my family, and our adventures.  While the idea is to share our adventures with you,
                I'd like to also share some different aspects of our life.  I married my best friend when we were only teenagers and extremely shortly after
                we found ourselves expecting a very special joyous deliver.  We were soon to be kids raising a kid.
            </p>
       
            <p>
                Life immediately became challenging, we were freshly out to challenge the world on our own with no life experience, no job experience or specials skills,
                and were now responsible for a life other than our own.  We struggled, but we managed then we were notified of our second special delivery.  It didn't
                take long for us to realize we needed to make a decision quick or we'd continue to struggle.  So I decided to enlist in the military.  This helped tremendously,
                we didn't make a lot of money but we now had health care and the security that we'd know we'd have a place to live.  We decided to continue to growing our family while
                we remained in the military to have a total of 5 children, ultimately completing our party of seven.
             </p>
       
            <p>
                It was always a dream of my wife's to live an adventurous life.  After all many things can be bought but you can never buy more time.  With that in mind,
                and with a little help from the military sending us to different places of the word we decided to have ourselves some adventures.  We've been fortunate to visit
                many states and even found ourselves in Australia for a couple of years.  While it never seems quite enough nor does there ever seem to find ourselves with
                enough resources to do as much traveling as we'd like, we make due with what we can.  I hope to be able to share our adventures with you and hopefully 
                encourage you to travel (time is short Friend) as well as re-assure you that it can be done with less money if you plan wisely.
            </p>
